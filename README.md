# Array Sorting Algorithms

This project contains implementations of various array sorting algorithms and a script to test their performance.

## Description

The main file, `arraysort.py`, includes implementations of merge sort, quick sort, and bubble sort. It also includes a `main` function that tests these algorithms on arrays of different sizes and generates a graph of their performance.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies
