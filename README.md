# Array Sorting Algorithms

This project contains implementations of various array sorting algorithms and a script to test their performance.
It also uses matplotlib to show a graph (log scale).

## Description

The main file, `arraysort.py`, includes implementations of merge sort, quick sort, and bubble sort. It also includes a `main` function that tests these algorithms on arrays of different sizes and generates a graph of their performance.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

This project was tested in Python 3.10. It also requires the following packages:

- matplotlib

Vscode was used as the enviroment, with the default python extension installed.

### Installing

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required packages with pip:
